# Score and Strike Entry System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the Score and Strike Entry System updates according to the instruction document. The system now includes enhanced entry management, kickoff time validation, winner determination, and pot management.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Entry Management
- **Fixture-specific entries**: Each entry is now tied to a specific fixture and gameweek
- **Multiple entry handling**: Only the most recent entry before kickoff is stored
- **Entry overwriting**: Resubmissions update the existing entry rather than creating duplicates
- **0-0 prediction support**: Goalscorer field is stored as empty string for 0-0 predictions

### 2. Kickoff Time Validation
- **Entry locking**: No entries or edits allowed after kickoff time
- **Real-time status**: UI shows "Locked" status when fixture has started
- **Error messages**: Clear feedback when users try to submit after kickoff
- **UTC time handling**: All time comparisons use UTC to match FPL API

### 3. Winner Determination Logic
- **Three criteria matching**: Home goals, away goals, and goalscorer must all be correct
- **Goalscorer validation**: 
  - For 0-0 results: goalscorer must be empty
  - For goals scored: predicted goalscorer must match at least one actual goalscorer
- **Multiple winners**: Multiple managers can win in a week, or none
- **Winner storage**: Winners are recorded in the database with their predictions

### 4. Pot Management
- **Starting pot**: Uses admin configuration (`Si`) as the starting amount
- **Pot rollover**: If no winners, pot increases by `Si` for next week
- **Pot reset**: If winners found, pot resets to `Si`
- **Current pot display**: Shows current pot amount in dollars ($) on the Score and Strike tab

## Database Schema Updates

### New Tables
1. **ScoreStrikePot**: Tracks pot amounts and status
   - `fplleague_id`, `gameweek`, `current_amount`, `starting_amount`, `is_active`

2. **ScoreStrikeWinner**: Records winners and their details
   - `fplleague_id`, `gameweek`, `fixture_id`, manager details, `won_amount`

### Updated Tables
1. **ScoreStrikeEntry**: Enhanced with fixture tracking
   - Added `fixture_id` and `gameweek` fields
   - Updated indexes for efficient querying

## API Endpoints

### `/api/score-strike`
- **POST** with actions:
  - `determine_winners`: Determines winners for a specific fixture
  - `update_pot`: Updates pot for a gameweek
  - `get_current_pot`: Retrieves current pot amount

## UI Enhancements

### Score and Strike Tab
- **Current pot display**: Shows pot amount prominently
- **Fixture lock status**: Visual indicators for locked fixtures
- **Entry error handling**: Clear error messages for validation failures
- **Admin controls**: Buttons for testing winner determination and pot updates
- **Enhanced rules**: Updated instructions reflecting new system

### Form Validation
- **Kickoff time checking**: Prevents submissions after kickoff
- **0-0 prediction handling**: Goalscorer field disabled for 0-0 scores
- **Entry status messages**: Shows when entries are locked or submitted

## Key Functions

### Entry Management
- `saveScoreStrikeEntry()`: Handles entry creation/updates with overwrite logic
- `getScoreStrikeEntryByManagerAndFixture()`: Retrieves specific user entries
- `loadUserEntry()`: Loads existing entries when fixture is selected

### Winner Determination
- `determineWinners()`: API call to determine winners for a fixture
- `checkWinner()`: Validates if an entry matches actual results
- `extractGoalscorers()`: Extracts goalscorer data from FPL API

### Pot Management
- `updatePot()`: API call to update pot for a gameweek
- `loadCurrentPot()`: Loads and displays current pot amount
- `getCurrentScoreStrikePot()`: Database function to get current pot

## Testing Features

### Admin Controls
- **View All Entries**: Console output of all database entries
- **Determine Winners**: Test winner determination for selected fixture
- **Update Pot**: Test pot update functionality

### Gameweek Testing
- **All 38 Gameweeks**: Buttons to test each gameweek's fixture selection
- **Team Priority Logic**: Automatic fixture selection based on team priorities

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. Select a fixture from the available options
2. Enter home and away goals
3. Select a goalscorer (or leave blank for 0-0)
4. Submit before kickoff time
5. View current pot amount and entry status

### For Admins
1. Use admin controls to test winner determination
2. Update pot amounts for new gameweeks
3. Monitor entries and winners through database queries

## Technical Notes

### Database Version
- Updated to version 10 with new tables and indexes
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing data

### API Integration
- Uses FPL API for fixture data and results
- Caches data to minimize API calls
- Handles timezone conversion properly

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages for users
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- Console logging for debugging

## Future Enhancements
- Automated winner determination after gameweek completion
- Email notifications for winners
- Enhanced goalscorer mapping from FPL API
- Historical winner tracking and statistics
